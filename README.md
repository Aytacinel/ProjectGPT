# Python Based ChatGPT Software House Simulator

## Overview

This Flask-based application is designed to emulate the workings of a software house. Users can initiate software projects, for which the application can generate user interface designs, frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) codes, and backend Python codes.

## Features

### 1. Project Creation

Users can start a new software project by providing specific details such as the project name, description, and technologies involved.

### 2. User Interface Design Generation

Once a project is created, the application can produce UI designs. These designs seem to be based on data read from files, possibly mimicking input from a UX/UI designer.

### 3. Frontend Code Generation

- **HTML Code**: The application generates HTML code tailored to the project's specifications.
- **CSS Code**: Corresponding CSS code is also generated to style the HTML content.
- **JavaScript Code**: JavaScript code can be produced to enhance the frontend interactivity.

### 4. Backend Code Generation

Python code is generated to serve as the backend for the software project. This code is organized into multiple blocks and files, possibly representing different functionalities or modules.

### 5. Code Organization

The application seems to be capable of splitting and saving the generated code into distinct files. This feature ensures a modular and organized codebase, making it easier for developers to navigate and manage.
